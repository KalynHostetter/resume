    <h2>My Interests</h2>
    <hr/>
    <h3>Music</h3>
        <p>
            I have always loved music since before I can remember. <br/>
            I sing, write music, and play various instruments: trumet, melophone, ukulele, and piano. <br/>
            Here's a photo of me with my former college a cappella group,

        <ul>
            <li>Death and Taxes</li>

    <h3>Art</h3>
        <p>
            While I have been involved in the arts since my sister and I would put on fashion shows <br/>
            and dance performances for our parents, I recently have been only focusing on a few: <br/>
            poetry, photography, oragami, and denim customization. Here are some jeans I painted.
